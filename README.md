Exchanging data between webRTC endpoints(peers) using an RTC DataCHannel

This web application usesRTCPeerConnection and a webRTC data channel to send texts between two textarea elements on the same page - for the sake of demonstration purposes. One text area will allow the user to enter text while the other will be displaying the text after it is sent.
